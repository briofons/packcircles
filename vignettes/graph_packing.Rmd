Another approach to circle packing is to begin with a specification of circle sizes and tangencies (ie. which circles touch which other circles) and then search for an arrangement satisfying this. Such an algorithm was described by Collins and Stephenson in a [2003 paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772102000998) in the journal Computation Geometry Theory and Applications. A version of their algorithm was implemented in Python by David Eppstein as part of his PADS library (see [CirclePack.py](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/)). A port of this version to R/Rcpp is included in the packcircles package.


In the figure below, the graph on the left represents the desired pattern of circle tangencies. Circles 5, 7, 8 and 9 are *internal*, while the remaining circles are *external*. The packing on the right shows an arrangement of circles which conforms to
the input graph.
